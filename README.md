# The Good Parts
## Plex app to play the good parts of movies.
Sometimes I don't want to invest the time for a movie, or can't decide on one.
I want a solution that picks a movie and plays it at "the good part".

Sure, it sounds like TV - but no commercials and you can pick the decade or genre.

## Technical notes
Source: klipd.com is a dead website that's still up (but not being maintained) that hosts these movie clips. This project will pull the data and organize it in a database. The first solution is a plex app that will display and play clips from the database.

Tools: python3, postgres, beautiful soup.

Plan: to be able to pull this project into plex app store and play random clips.
